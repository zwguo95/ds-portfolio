Last week, I introduced how to visualize disparities in tree equity scores using [hexbin maps](https://medium.com/@zhaowenguo/green-space-for-everyone-visualizing-tree-equity-gap-9e02f5278480). Hexbin maps are a useful tool for visualizing dense data points by summarizing them in a compact and understandable format. By grouping data points into hexagonal bins, they provide a clear picture of the spatial distribution of the data, enabling the detection of patterns that may be hidden by overplotting. 

However, while hexagonal bins provide a clean representation of data, they result in information loss regarding the underlying shape of the data. For example, my [previous visual](https://medium.com/@zhaowenguo/green-space-for-everyone-visualizing-tree-equity-gap-9e02f5278480) using hexbin maps suggests that Ohio has the largest tree equity gap, which is defined as the maximum difference across county-level tree equity scores, but this does not provide a complete picture. When examining the distribution of tree equity scores across census blocks within each state, it is clear that Ohio has a considerable number of blocks with relatively high levels of tree equity, indicating that Ohio performs well in this regard.
