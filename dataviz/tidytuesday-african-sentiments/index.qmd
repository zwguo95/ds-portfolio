[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project aimed at improving skills in data manipulation, visualization and analysis using R programming language. [This week](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-02-28/readme.md), we are exploring the African language sentiments. I experimented with a different way to represent proportion by using a measuring cup! I adjusted the positioning and size of the cup so that the actual proportion aligned with the markings on the cup. Please find my code [here](https://github.com/zwguo95/TidyTuesday/tree/main/2023/0228)!
