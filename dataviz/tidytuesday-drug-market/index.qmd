[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project aimed at improving skills in data manipulation, visualization and analysis using R programming language. [This week](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-03-14/readme.md), we are exploring the the development of European drugs scraped by Miquel Anglada Girotto from [European Medicines Agency](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/download-medicine-data). I found that drugs developed for COVID-19 were brought to market much faster than non-COVID drugs. To emphasize this key finding, I incorporated a magnifying glass logo into my visualization to make it more eye-catching. Please find my code [here](https://github.com/zwguo95/TidyTuesday/tree/main/2023/0314)!
