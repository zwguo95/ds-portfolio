The graph on the left illustrates the proportion of AI-related news headlines across eight dominant themes by media leanings. Left-leaning outlets tend to focus more on safety and risk topics, adopting a cautious perspective. In contrast, right-leaning media emphasize AI stocks, suggesting a more pragmatic or neutral attitude toward AI.

The graph on the right analyzes the trend of fear-mongering headlines over time among media with varying ideological leanings. The majority of these fear-inducing headlines come from left-leaning outlets.

Tech companies also play a key role in shaping AI coverage. Open AI continues to capture media spotlight, but numerous competitors have emerged. Among tech giants, Google and Microsoft have been early adopters in AI development, while Amazon entered the AI field at a later stage.

There's been consistent hype surrounding open-source AI. Initially, news about open-source AI could trigger fear, but this cautionary coverage has decreased over time. The smaller portion of news stories that raises concerns about open-source AI focuses on potential risks like security vulnerabilities, large-scale misuse, and worries about intellectual property and control.
