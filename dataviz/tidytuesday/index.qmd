[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly data project that encourages data enthusiasts to practice their skills in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using R. Each week, a unique dataset is provided, allowing participants to explore a variety of topics and hone their R programming skills. Below, you'll find a collection of my TidyTuesday visualizations, each accompanied by a brief description and a link to the corresponding code.

### Haunted Places Sentiment Analysis (10/10/2023)

![Haunted Places](spooky_wa.png)
**Highlights:**

-   Created a beeswarm plot to represent the distribution of fear sentiment across various haunted locations.

-   Discovered that the DoubleTree Hotel in Spokane and the Civil War Cemetery in Seattle have the highest fear sentiment scores.

The [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-10-10/readme.md) focused on haunted locations and their associated fear sentiment scores. Using a basic sentiment analysis, I scored each location from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating intense fear sentiment. The beeswarm plot provides a fresh twist on traditional scatter plots, effectively showing the distribution of fear levels across locations.
