<div class="main-content">

I am a **social and data scientist** interested in the intersection of experimental design, survey methodology, and machine learning. My research focuses on developing metrics for social constructs using innovative data collection and evaluating the impact of digital interventions on civic behavior and public opinion. I work with diverse data sources—including administrative, survey, text, and spatial data—and collaborate widely with government agencies and tech companies.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Better Government Lab](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/better-government-lab/), Georgetown University.
